# Space_Tourism_Agency_Website
Website for a Space Tourism Agency built with HTM, CSS &amp; JavaScript for NASA Space Apps Hackathon

As part of the Nasa Space Apps Challenges hackathon, we made an educational website about space travelling that also provides customised itineraries for future travellers who want to visit the Solar System, starting with: the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

On the home page, there are 3 space objects: Moon, Mars and Venus, rotating at different speeds (similar to how they actually rotate in space). Clicking on each planet will redirect you to that planet's specific page, which contains general information about the planet and an AI-generated marketing video, showing what a journey on that planet would look like. Furthermore, the bottom of the page contains a quiz, asking you a couple of questions and at the end you will receive a personalised Travel Itinerary for your journey, either to the Moon or to Mars (in pdf format).

With our website, you can learn about space travel, discover the Solar System and imagine how a space journey would be like in the future. From a commercial point of view, our project could also represent the website of a future space tourism agency, integrating services from multiple space companies like SpaceX, Axiom Space, Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, and in this way providing a complete travel package to potential clients interested in Space Tourism beyond Earth's Low Earth Orbit.

Technologies & tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canva, QuizMaker, Visual Studio and IntelliJ, 000webhost + a couple of AI tools such as ImagineAi, AIinVideo to generate videos and images.
